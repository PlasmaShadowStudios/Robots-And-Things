9:T5b1,Hello again !

Thank you all for sticking with us these past few months, a lot has changed in my life and I briefly needed to take a step away from the project to focus on my own life. After the end of the Kickstarter I picked up a new job to help fund progress, and this past week I just moved out and I'm now happily living with my girlfriend. It's taken a lot to get where I am now and I'm ready to jump back into the project in full force!

While we haven't been able to give Robots & Things our full attention that hasn't stopped us from working on some exciting new ideas for it, along with some crucial changes you asked for. In the past while Scott posted a new beta build for our patrons showcasing our **overhaul to the floaty physics and slippery movement**.

**Robots & Things will also be present at SAGE 2021**, with a new smaller version of the demo for you all to try featuring the new physics! If you'd like to try the entire demo with the new physics we'll have that available over on our Patreon, along with here on Discord in the exclusive Patron Chat.

**Thank you everyone who participated in our Pick An Object event a while back, we have the first set of results ready to share with you over in the chat right now!** Let us know what you think, and if you'd like to see some of the others now you can catch those over on our Patreon.

For now though, here's a first look at some new enemies coming to the game! Thanks again everyone!a:T40b, We would like to express our deepest thanks to everyone who has supported us and our game thus far. 

We're sad to see that the Kickstarter campaign didn't make it this run through, but we're committed to pushing onward to make the best game we possibly can.  **Development of Robots & Things will continue**, albeit likely at a slower rate and with a reduced scope for the time being. We have several contingency plans and we would be happy to discuss them all with you all to see what you think.

For now we've set up a **Patreon** where you guys can continue supporting and gain access to new Beta builds along with additional behind the scenes content. You'll also get special roles here on Discord that give access to some additional channels.
