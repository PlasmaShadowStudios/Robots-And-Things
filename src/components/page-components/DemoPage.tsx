        <b>Robots & Things</b> is 3D Collect-a-thon Platformer that blends
        exploring big interconnected worlds with challenging action levels, all
        loaded with secrets and silly characters to meet. We were inspired by
        particular games like Super Mario Sunshine and Super Metroid, as well as
        series like Crash Bandicoot, Sonic, and Banjo-Kazooie.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        We&apos;re bringing together the best elements of past games, along with
        fresh new ideas like the <b>move meter</b> and{" "}
        <b>score progression system</b>.
        <br />
